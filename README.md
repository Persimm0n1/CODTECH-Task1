# Linear Regression Analysis on California Housing Data

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for performing Linear Regression analysis on the California Housing Data. The goal is to predict median house prices based on various features using a simple Linear Regression model and visualize the results using graphs.

## Dataset
The California Housing dataset used in this project includes:
- **Features:** Median income, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, latitude, and longitude.
- **Target Variable:** Median house value for a block (dependent variable).

The dataset is sourced from https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html

## Files
- **`Linear_Regression.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.


## Dependencies
- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linear-regression-california-housing.git](https://github.com/Persimm0n1/CODTECH-Task1
   cd linear-regression-california-housing
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   !pip install pandas
   !pip install NumPy
   !pip install Matplotlib
   !pip install Seaborn


3. Open and run the `Linear_Regression.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter to see the analysis and results.

## Analysis
### Steps Covered:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning data, handling missing values, and transforming features.
   
2. **Model Training:**
   - Implementing Linear Regression using Scikit-learn.
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Plotting scatter plots of features vs. median house prices.
   - Displaying the regression line fitted to the data points.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Calculating metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate model performance.
   - Calculating metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate model performance.
   - Calculating metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance.

## Results
The analysis demonstrates the relationship between various features and median house prices in California. The Linear Regression model provides insights into how these features influence housing values, offering a foundational understanding of predictive modeling in real estate.
